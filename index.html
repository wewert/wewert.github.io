    <h2><font size="6" face="verdana" color="white">Exploration Systems and Machine Learning Or About Mod 1</font></h2>
    <p><font size="4" face="verdana" color="white">Mod 1 was hard. Really, really hard. I was told it was going to be hard and very stressful but there is nothing in my personal experience that would have prepared me for this. And that includes my messed up childhood. NOTHING compares or can get you ready for this. All things being what they are, I have journeyed beyond anything I thought I could have done. The number one thing I've learned is to be self reflective. To understand that "failure" is not the end but the beginings of where to start to learn/grow. To not let that moment stop me in my tracks. To cause me to turn and run the other way. I now more frequently face it and learn from it and keep stepping forward. I tell myself "I can't do this right now but what can I do?".
